• This update introduces a few major accessibility enhancements, including VoiceOver descriptions of conversation messages.
• Even if your thumbs are slow, sending messages will still be faster whenever you tap the send button in large groups.
• The new design for the attachment upload and download progress indicators might look even better than the attachment that they sent you.
• Several low-memory crashes have become distant-memory crashes, so you can forget about them.
